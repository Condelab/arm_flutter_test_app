# flutter_test_app

This is a flutter chat test app

The essence of this app is to test my ability with flutter

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

# My thoughts

The app appears and sounds easy to build but in actual fact there are a million things to consider before diving into the app.

Though I have a solid knowledge of flutter, combination of some widget especially on the chatScreen page has to be done care fully or you runn into render, overflow errors, etc.

I wanted to add a lot of functionality just to build my chat app sills, but the time constraint and the principle of KISS (keep it simple) was ringing deep down.

On a final note, this is not my best, but i know this is better enough to show you I can grow with you if am allowed to.
